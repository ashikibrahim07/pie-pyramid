# Pie Pyramid

This project showcases an interesting optical illusion where a pie chart image resembles an ordinary pie chart at first glance but is actually a pyramid portrait when examined closely.

## Description

This repository contains an HTML/CSS code implementation of a pie chart design that appears as a traditional pie chart on the surface but reveals a pyramid portrait upon closer inspection. The design features three main colors: sky blue for the sky, yellow for the pyramid, and black for shadow.

## Demo

You can view a live demo of the pie pyramid [here](https://ashikibrahim07.github.io/pie-pyramid/).
