# Pie Pyramid

This project showcases an interesting optical illusion where a pie chart image resembles an ordinary pie chart at first glance but is actually a pyramid portrait when examined closely.

## Description

Within this repository lies an HTML/CSS code rendition of a pie chart design initially resembling a conventional pie chart but revealing a pyramid portrait upon closer scrutiny. The design showcases three primary hues: sky blue for the sky, yellow representing the pyramid, and black for the shadow effect. I've accomplished this using `conic-gradient`.

## Demo
